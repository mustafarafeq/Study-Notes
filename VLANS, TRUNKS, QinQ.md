# What is a VLAN?
## VLAN
 - Virtual Area Network

 Traditionally used to segment or seperate different devices on a network. This replaces simple LANS (Local Area Networks) as VLANS dont require a physical layer 2 connection between devices because those dont scale well and dont allow for cross-domain communication.

 A typical ethernet frame has a source and destination MAC address field along with a payload, which is the data being sent or received. In a VLAN, a new field is added to the ethernet frame called 802.1Q or 802.1AD (Q-inQ).

 In summary, VLANS function by creating isolated, virtual network segments on a single physical network infrastructure that enables devices to be grouped together regardless of their physical location.
